	<br/><font size='18'>Recommendations:</font>
	<br/>
	<br/>1. Do not use damage modifiers on players and only use them on unmoded A3 AI units with exception when using OPTRE mod.
	<br/>
	<br/>2. Do not stay assigned to Zeus. This will keep the AI load on dedicated server. This does not apply to local hosted servers and host is Admin by default.
	<br/>
	<br/>3. This mission works great with optional ASR_AI3 mod. After installation go to Configure Addons and set radio distance less than or equal to zone trigger distance to reduce unnecessary load on server. Use -filePatching launch parameter.
	<br/>
	<br/>4. Allow use of CBA_A3 mod and install it on the server. This will add extra actions/exclusive mission features on aircraft for players; 1.Bail from Chopper 2.Auto Countermeasure for fixed wing 3.3D Turret Compass
	<br/>
	<br/>5. The optional reccomended mods above can be hidden and not be made a requirement of clients by not editing this mission with these mods enabled and using -serverMod launch parameter.
	<br/>
	<br/>6. Lower Server Difficulty setting viewDistance to 1000-1200 for increased performance. Note this also affects air patrole spotting/weapons engagement capability.
	<br/>
	<br/>7. Restrict mods by using server keys and install all non client side mods on server for maximum performance of server and all clients.
	<br/>
	<br/>For example, each bullet fired causes an error on machines that do not have the mod it comes from and that moded chopper/uniform the client is flying in which server or some players cannot see has no armor for those machines missing the mod. Performance will continually degrade after some time for all machines. This mission can run weeks on end without performance degradation if these steps are taken.
	<br/>
	<br/>8. Restoring mission progression is only intended to work with one terrain. This means you must load the same terrain mission version in wich saving progession was enabled. Ex. Saving progression on BMR Insurgency Altis was enabled then Admin loaded BMR Insurgency Tanoa with progession restoration enabled. This will not work correctly.
	<br/>
	<br/>9. Manually kicking Headless Client will effectivley reset/reinforce uncaptured zones as if no enemy had been killed in these zones when HC(s) reconnect/JIP.  If using 2 headless clients then both should be kicked at the same time. As a side affect, the current objective may complete or it's defences deleted because all enemy AI get deleted when a headless client disconnects and leaves AI behind.
	<br/>
	<br/>10. The server does not automatically begin saving progression until one task has been completed.
