Supported: @ACE3 stand alone or in addition to any mod listed here. Should be installed server and client side.

Optional Reccomended Mods:
1. @ASR_AI3
	This mod is highly reccomended to enhance AI behavior. It puts the dumb lifeless AI to work and makes for some serious live action.
	Robalo, the creator of ASR_AI3 has a great track record of keeping this mod working, updated and the mod does what he advertises.
	One of the main features is that it makes AI groups communicate about your known position via radio up to a set distance.
	Another is that it will make them travel through buildings and clear them out.
	These prameters as well as meny others can be configured via Configure Addons ingame GUI.
	It should be installed on server. It can be hidden with launch parameter -serverMod= if you wish to have no mod requirements when joining server.
	If you are using a headless client then it should be installed on server and headless client.
	If you run it on client then it will affect recuited AI and Zeused AI (client side AI).
2. @CBA_A3
	This mod is often a requirement for other mods and as far as I know has no compatibiliy issues with any other mod besides the depricated joint_rails mod wich is now built into CBA_A3.
	If mod is installed on server only then client will not have additional features.
	If mod is installed on client and server then the following features will be added to players when they are in Helicopters or Fixed Wing.
		1. Bail from helicopters action. Existing backpack is moved to ventral position and parachute pack added to back. Once landed original loadout will be restored.
			Pilot cannot bail unless helicopter has at least 70% damage to engine or at least 70% overall damage. Others can bail at anytime.
			Chute will auto open unless ACE3 mod is running.
		2. Earplug action within helicopters or fixed wing.
		3. 3D Compass when in gunner or turret view within helicopters.
		4. HALO action within fixed wing. Same restrictions apply as in helicopter bail.
		5. Auto Flare Countermeasure action within fixed wing. Flares are not depleted from aircraft's loadout. It generates its own unlimited supply.
3. @Hidden_Identity_v3, @Hidden_Identity_v2 and @AVON_FM12_Respirator_Pack in any combination or sperately for Gas Masks. @AVON_FM12_Respirator_Pack support limited to FM-12 strapless.
	They are used by the client so should be installed client side. For best performance install server and client side.
4. @Ares
	This mod adds extra functionality to Zeus and can be installed on client only.

Handy commands for logged in Administrators or local Hosts of BMR Insurgency through debug console (escape key):
	1. To change time on the fly substitute 8 to desired number of hours and execute on server:
			skiptime + 8;
	To Change brigthness if Brighter Nights is enabled then this command may be required after changing time.
			Toggle Brighter Nights in new Brefing Admin Panel (requires admin login for access).
